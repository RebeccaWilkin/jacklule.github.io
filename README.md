##Repo for Lehigh journalism Data Vizualization

<p>I set up this repo as part of a new journalism module, Data Visualization. <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus">The syllabus can be found here at GitHub.com.</a></p>

<p>My hope is that each student will set up a repo as a means to submit and publish Data Viz assignments.</p>

I am still researching other alternatives, which could be on or off GitHub. But ultimately I would like students to become more familiar with GitHub and its process of submitting and publishing work.

<p>Students of course would first need to set up an account. <a href="https://github.com">It is easy at GitHub.com.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/"> I then followed this GitHub Pages guide, using "User or organization" site and "GitHub for Mac."</a></p>

**UPDATE**: After a month of trial, I think github.io will work for students. The students will learn to create a new html page to embed and publish each assignment thus doubling the value of each lesson. To get them set up:

- Students first must **set up their text editor to create html pages**. For the Mac, this means to edit Preferences in Apple TextEdit. [Apple Support: How to Set Up TextEdit](https://support.apple.com/kb/ta20406?locale=en_US). In sum: Under Preferences, Click the Plain Text radio button for New Document Format; Under Saving, click the checkbox to turn off "Append '.txt' extension to plain text files."
- Students then **set up their repo site at github.io**, retracing my steps at [Git Hub Pages guide above](https://pages.github.com/)
- **To publish work saved on the local computer**, such as svg files produced by Chartbuilder: 1) Students would complete the assignment at Chartbuilder; 2) download the svg file to their local computer (the other option, png files, do not render consistently); 3) create an html page for the assignment; 4) insert the svg file into the html page; 5) upload the html page to their github.io site. Here is an example of a Chartbuilder assignment: [Chartbuilder svg test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/SVGtest.html)
- **To embed and publish work hosted on sites**, such as Tableau or YouTube: 1) Students would complete the assignment on Tableau; 2) get the embed code at Tableau; 3) create an html page for the assignment; 4) embed the Tableau work into the html page; 5) upload the html page to their github.io site. Here are examples: [You Tube Embed Test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/YouTubeEmbedTest.html) and [Tableau Embed Test](http://jacklule.github.io/pages/embed-test-Tableau.html)
- **To "hand in" the assignment**, students would: 1) Copy the file path --"copy path" -- for the assignment page and paste that link into a "Portfolio" page created for name.github.io; 2) The students may need to add http:// in front of the assigment file path name on their Portfolio page for the url to work; 3) Students would then notfiy me that the assignment was completed and send me the url for the Portfolio page.
- **The Portfolio** page would be a collection of their Data Viz work that can be shared with future employers.

**File and Folder management** is important.

Creating folders within GitHub:
- go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder
- click on New file
- on the text field for creatng the file name, after the /, type the *folder* name you want to create and hit Enter
- on the next text field to the right, after the /, type the *file* name (type .md if you want that style) and hit Enter
- this creates a folder.
