<h1>Repo for Data Viz project pages</h1>

<p>I set up this repo as a possible site for students to submit Data Viz assignments.</p>

<The README.MD page has details as well as background information on how I set things up.</p>

<p>I am still researching other alternatives, which could be on or off GitHub.
But ultimately I would like students to become more familiar with GitHub by submitting and getting work.</p>

<p>UPDATE: It seems like the best option might be: 1) students set up a repository like this site: name.github.io; 2) Upload html pages from the local GitHub for Mac; 3) Copy the file path --"copy path" -- for each page and paste links into a "home page," the README.MD page for name.github.io; 4) Need to add http:// in front of file path name for correct address.</p>

<p></p>For example: Here are links to the two html test documents I have uploaded to this repo:</p>

<p><a href="http://jacklule.github.io/YouTubeEmbedTest.html">Embed YouTube test.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://jacklule.github.io/SVGtest.html">Test of embedding a Chartbuilder svg file.</a></p>

<p>All to be hosted with GitHub pages.</p>
<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Followed this GitHub Pages guide.</a></p>
<p>I had trouble adding this html page from my local computer. This attempt worked but needed first to edit preferences in my Macbook's Apple TextEdit.</p>

<p>Under Preferences, Click the Plain Text radio button for New Document Format.</p>
<p>Under Saving, click the checkbox to turn off "Append '.txt' extension to plain text files."</p>
