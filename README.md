##Repo for Data Viz project pages

I set up this repo as a possible site for students to submit Data Viz assignments.
I am still researching other alternatives.
But ultimately I would like students to become more familiar with GitHub by submitting and getting work.

UPDATE: It seems like the best option might be: 1) students set up a repository like this page: name.github.io; 2) upload html pages from the local GitHub for Mac; 3) Copy "file path" for each page and paste links into a "home page," the Index page for name.github.io.

The Chronicle of Higher Education offers some good guides, geared for academics.
