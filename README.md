##Repo for Data Viz project pages

I set up this repo as part of a new journalism module, Data Visualization. My hope is that each student will set up a repo as a means to submit and publish Data Viz assignments.

I am still researching other alternatives, which could be on or off GitHub. But ultimately I would like students to become more familiar with GitHub and its process of submitting and publishing work.

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/"> I followed this GitHub Pages guide, using "User or organization" site and "GitHub for Mac."</a></p>

UPDATE: After a month of trial, I think github.io will work for students. The students will learn to create a new html page to embed and publish each assignment thus doubling the value of each lesson. To get them set up:

- Students first set up their repo site at github.io, retracing my steps at [Git Hub Pages guide above](https://pages.github.com/)
- To publish work saved on the local computer, such as svg files produced by Chartbuilder :
- To embed and publish work hosted on sites, such as YouTube or Tableau:
- To "hand in" the assignment, students would: 1) Copy the file path --"copy path" -- for each the page and paste that link into a "Assignments" page, such as this README.MD page, for name.github.io; 2) They may need to add http:// in front of the file path name on their for correct address; 3) Students would then contact me with the url for their Assignment page.

For example: Here are links to two html test documents I have uploaded to this repo:
