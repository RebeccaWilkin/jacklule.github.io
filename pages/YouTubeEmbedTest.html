<p>I was wondering if GitHub could support html pages that had embed codes from sites such as YouTube.</p>
<p>I had already edited preferences in my Macbook's Apple TextEdit.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/ta20406?locale=en_US">Apple Support: How to Set Up TextEdit.</a></p>
<p>I then just created an html page in TextEdit and added an embed code from YouTube.</p>
<p>The original dimensions, 560x315, seemed small. I multiplied by 1.5, 840x472.5.</p>
<p>I decided to have fun and changed the font size and color of the source.</p>
<p>It all worked.</p>
