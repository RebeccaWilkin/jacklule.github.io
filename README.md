# jacklule.github.io: README

<p>I originally set up this repository (repo) simply to be part of a new journalism module, Data Visualization. <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus">The syllabus can be found here at GitHub.com.</a></p>

<p>However, I quickly realized that the GitHub "user page" --<i>github.com/USER_NAME</i> -- was the appropriate place to set up the syllabus. The user page can hold many repos for various syllabi and other projects.</p>

<p>It appears that <i>USER_NAME.github.io</i> is much more appropriate as a kind of staging ground, landing page or portfolio for work at <i>github.com/USER_NAME</i>.</p>

<p>My hope then is that my students and I thus will have portfolios of our work on GitHub.</p>

<p>Instructions that take my students through the entire process of registering for GitHub, creating a user page and establishing a repository for a portfolio can be found at the [GitHub SetUp page](https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md) of my Data Visualization syllabus.</p>

<p>I subsequently found [an excellent tutorial on using GitHub for Web portfolios](http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/)by Dan Nguyen.
