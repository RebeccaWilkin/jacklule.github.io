# jacklule.github.io -- README

<p>I originally set up this repository (repo) simply to be part of a new journalism module, Data Visualization. The <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus">syllabus</a> can be found here at GitHub.com.</p>

<p>However, I soon learned that GitHub has two different ways of hosting work. The GitHub "user page" --<b>github.com/USER_NAME</b> -- was the appropriate place to set up the syllabus. The user page can hold many repos for various syllabi and other projects.</p>

<p>GitHub Pages -- <b>USER_NAME.github.io</b> -- is a repo on the user page. But it allows for the .io Internet domain name (like.com). It is much more appropriate as a kind of web site, staging ground, landing page or portfolio for work at <i>github.com/USER_NAME</i>.</p>

<p>My hope is that my students and I thus will have portfolios to display our work hosted on GitHub.</p>

<p>Instructions that take my students through the entire process of registering for GitHub, creating a user page and establishing a repository for a portfolio can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md">GitHub SetUp page</a> of my Data Visualization syllabus.</p>

<p>I subsequently found an excellent [tutorial on using GitHub for Web portfolios](http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/)by Dan Nguyen.
