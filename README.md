# jacklule.github.io -- README

<p>I originally set up this repository (repo) to be part of a new journalism module, Data Visualization. The <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus">syllabus</a> can be found here at GitHub.com.</p>

<p>I learned early on that GitHub offered different ways of hosting work, including a "user" page, such as <b>name.github.io</b>, and a "project" page, such as <b>name.github.io/project</b>.</p> 

<p>For example, <a href="http://dwillis.github.io">Derek Willis</a> hosts his syllabi as html project pages, which are sub-directories of dwillis.github.io, such as his <a href="http://dwillis.github.io/data-reporting/">data reporting syllabus</a>. <a href="http://mattwaite.github.io">Matt Waite</a> uses mattwaite.github.io as a kind of portfolio of his GitHub work, including class syllabi, to be found at <a href="http://githumb.com/mattwaite">github.com.mattwaite</a>.</p>

<p>I see the advantages of both. I decided though to follow the lead of Matt Waite and setup my user page, [jacklule.gitub.io](http://jacklule.github.io) to serve as a portfolio of my workAnd my original GitHub "user page" --<b>github.com/USER_NAME</b> -- was the appropriate place to set up the syllabus. The user page can hold many repos for various syllabi and other projects.</p>

<p>A GitHub Page -- <b>USER_NAME.github.io</b> -- actually is just another repo on the user page. BUT it allows for the .io Internet domain name (like.com). A GitHub Page thus is much more appropriate as a kind of web site, staging ground, landing page or portfolio for work done at <b>github.com/USER_NAME</b>.</p>

<p>My hope is that my students and I thus will have portfolios to display our work hosted on GitHub.</p>

<p>Instructions that take my students through the entire process of registering for GitHub, creating a user page and establishing a repository for a portfolio can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md">GitHub SetUp page</a> of my Data Visualization syllabus.</p>

<p>I subsequently found an excellent [tutorial on using GitHub for Web portfolios](http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/) by Dan Nguyen.
