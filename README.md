# jacklule.github.io -- README

<p>I originally set up this repository (repo) to be part of a new journalism module, Data Visualization. The <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus">syllabus</a> can be found here at GitHub.com.</p>

<p>I learned early on that GitHub offered different ways of hosting work, including a "user" page, such as <b>name.github.io</b>, and a "project" page, such as <b>name.github.io/project</b>, as well as a contributor's page, such as <b>github.com/name</b>.</p> 

<p>For example, <a href="http://dwillis.github.io">Derek Willis</a> hosts his syllabi as html project pages, which are sub-directories of dwillis.github.io, such as his <a href="http://dwillis.github.io/data-reporting/">data reporting syllabus</a>.</p>

<p>But <a href="http://mattwaite.github.io">Matt Waite</a> uses mattwaite.github.io as a kind of portfolio of his GitHub work, including class syllabi, to be found at <a href="http://github.com/mattwaite">github.com.mattwaite</a>.</p>

<p>I see the advantages of both. I decided though to follow the lead of Matt Waite and set up my user page, <a href="http://jacklule.github.io">jacklule.gitub.io</a> to serve as a collection of my GitHub work, including syllabi, at <a href="http://github.com/jacklule">github.com/jacklule</a>. portfolio of my work.</p>

<p>I think it will be good for my students to work regularly in GitHub, rather than at an html page. My hope too is that my students and I thus will have portfolios that display our work on GitHub.</p>

<p>Instructions that take my students through the entire process of registering for GitHub, creating a user page and establishing a repository for a portfolio can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/jacklule/DataViz-Syllabus/blob/master/GitHubSetUp.md">GitHub SetUp page</a> of my Data Visualization syllabus.</p>

<p>I subsequently found an excellent [tutorial on using GitHub for Web portfolios](http://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/) by Dan Nguyen.
