##Repo for Data Viz project pages

I set up this repo as a possible site for students to submit Data Viz assignments.
I am still researching other alternatives, which could be on or off GitHub.
But ultimately I would like students to become more familiar with GitHub by submitting and getting work.

UPDATE: It seems like the best option might be: 1) students set up a repository like this site: name.github.io; 2) upload html pages from the local GitHub for Mac; 3) Copy the file path --"copy path" -- for each page and paste links into a "home page," the README.MD page for name.github.io.

For example: Here are the links to the two html test documents I have uploaded to this repo:
